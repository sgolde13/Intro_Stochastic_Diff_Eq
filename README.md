Applying Dynamic Harmonic Regression (DHR) using the ARIMA framework on super store sales data with seasonal temporal patterns. Based on "Dynamic Harmonic Regression" by Young et al, 1999.

The CAPTAIN TOOLBOX for System Identification, Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control, available in MatLab, was originally attempted. For ease of plotting and script writing we pivoted to the R-based "forecast" package, which was used to generate all of the results in the paper. The MatLab analysis script is labeled "Sales_DHR.m", with all other *.p and *.m files constituting the function references for the DHR computation. These ancillary scripts are copied from the CAPTAIN v83 download file.
